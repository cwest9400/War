# WAR!: Card battle game
### Win all the cards.
Two players, each play from half of a shuffled deck of cards. The top card of each deck is revealed and the highest value card, wins the card battle. The winner of the card battle places them in a side pile. If there is a tie, there's a war! Three cards from each players deck are ante'd up and then the fourth card from the top of the deck is revealed. The player that wins the war keeps all the ante'd cards plus, all the revealed cards. The process repeats until one of the two players has no more cards to continue playing.
